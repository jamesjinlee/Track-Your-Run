## MyRuns5

In this installment of the myRuns fitness app I implemented a realtime cloud database (firebase) which allows users to sync the entries stored in their local SQlite database to the cloud. Users also log in through firebase authentification and multiple users can be created. In addition, I added a board navigation option that allows users to retrieve all entries from their friends from a server, as well as sync entries stored in their database to this server.
