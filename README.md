## 1st Implementation
The beginning creation of a simple app in which a user can register with his/her name, email, password, major, phone-number, and dartmouth class and sign in to enter a MainActivity page. The user can also take a profile picture that is cropped while registering.

## 2nd Implementation

in myRuns2 I implemented a main activity page in which you can choose the input type and activity type with spinner widgets. From there you can either go to a Map activity or a Manual Entry Activity. Additional functions were added such as editing profiles, editing settings, and adding fragments to the main activity

## 3rd Implementation

In this installment of myRuns I implemented the an SQlite database in order to save, load, and delete entries. Users can now save entries, browse the entries in the history fragment, and choose to delete the entries if they wish.

## 4th Implementation

In this installment of myRuns I implemented the an SQlite database in order to save, load, and delete entries. Users can now save entries, browse the entries in the history fragment, and choose to delete the entries if they wish.

## 5th Implementation

In this installment of the myRuns fitness app I implemented a realtime cloud database (firebase) which allows users to sync the entries stored in their local SQlite database to the cloud. Users also log in through firebase authentification and multiple users can be created. In addition, I added a board navigation option that allows users to retrieve all entries from their friends from a server, as well as sync entries stored in their database to this server.
